# Exploration of red kite migration using landscape productivity metrics
This repository facilitates a collaboration between Vogelwarte and Marius Somveille to use his [migration simulation model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14589-2) to explore whether the seasonal re-distribution of Swiss red kites can be replicated using landscape productivity (NDVI) metrics.

Data have been aggregated into 100 km hexagonal grid cells for each month from 2016 - 2023.
